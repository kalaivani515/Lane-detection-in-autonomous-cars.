# Lane-detection-in-autonomous-cars.
Lane detection in autonomous cars.
In this project you will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.
OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.
ALGORITHM USED IN OUR PROJECT:

BIRDS EYE VIEW ALGORITHM
KALMAN FILTER ALGORITHM
HOUGH LINE TRANSFORM ALGORITHM
DISTORTION CORRECTION ALGORITHM
RANSAC ALGORITHM
CANNY ALGORITHM
Conclusion:
In the methodology, we made use of the Python library and its functions such as the Canny Function through which we achieved edge detection. 
Then we used the Hough Transform technique that detected the straight lines in the image and identified the lane lines.
We made use of the polar coordinates since the Cartesian coordinates donâ€™t give us an appropriate slope of vertical and horizontal lines.
Finally, we combined the lane image with our zero-intensity image to show lane lines
